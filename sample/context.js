Staff at all levels shall be entitled to appeal against disciplinary actions taken against them and have their grievances heard and considered by the next management level to their immediate supervisor, if necessary. However, the said request for appeal must be constructively tabled but management decision will be deemed final.
// Unacceptable behavior that does not lead to immediate dismissal may be dealt with in any of the following manners: (a) Verbal Warning, (b) 2 Written query, (c) disciplinary hearing/Suspension and (d) Termination. An employee who receives up to three (3) warning letters is eligible for dismissal.
//             4.17.1. Warning for Misconduct
// Where an offence is committed which is not sufficiently serious to warrant summary dismissal or termination with notice, an official warning will be issued.  For the first offence “FIRST WARNING” will be issued, and for the second offence the “SECOND WARNING” will also be issued and can be followed by a suspension. If a third offence is then committed, within one year, the staff’s services may be terminated.
// The implication of a warning letter given is that the staff loses an opportunity (if due) for a promotion or salary increment within six (6) months of the receipt of the warning letter. Warnings for offences and for inefficiency are cumulative and will be viewed together when considering further disciplinary action to be taken against an erring staff. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a staff can be summarily dismissed for gross misconduct depending on the severity of the incident.
// Human Resource Department monitors attendance and punctuality records of all members of staff. A non-adherence to this policy may lead to the termination of an employee. Further disciplinary actions that may be taken are as follows:
//     i. 1st offence of lateness for minimum of 2 times in a month attracts a reprimand letter.
//     ii. 2nd offence of lateness for a minimum of 2 times a month attracts 1st warning letter.
//     iii. Where warning letter is issued and lateness persists 2 times in a month, this attracts 2nd and final warning letter.
//     iv. If such poor punctuality records persist, this attracts 3 days suspension from work without pay, and failure to improve may lead the organization to review the continuous employment of the staff.
//             4.17.2. Suspension
// Where an employee commits any serious misconduct, he/she may be suspended from duty without pay pending an investigation of the situation. Depending on the outcome of the investigation, the employee may be recalled to duty or the employee’s appointment may be terminated without any previous disciplinary action having been taken.
// The implication of Suspension is that apart from the time of seclusion without pay, the staff loses the opportunity (if due) for a promotion or salary increment within six (6) months from the effective date of the suspension.
//         4.18. Grievance Procedure

// A staff who feels that he/she has a grievance or feels that he/she has been subjected to unfair treatment may put such grievance or complaint in writing to management through the Human Resource Department.
// As a first step, the staff who has a grievance shall make this known as soon as possible to his immediate supervisor.
// If after 2 days the staff concerned has had no satisfactory answer or action taken on his/her grievance, he may then ask his/her manager to forward it to the Human Resource Department for disciplinary and further action.
// If after further seven days the matter has still not been brought to satisfactory conclusion, it may then be referred to the Executive Director directly. If after a further two weeks the matter is still not resolved satisfactorily, it may then be referred to the Managing Director whose decision on the matter is final.
// In order that appeals can be dealt with expeditiously without the need to refer for further information, supervisors transmitting appeals to higher authority must add their comments and suggestions when forwarding such appeals and indicate on the appeal that it has been submitted through them.
// Allegations made in appeals should normally be supported by proofs. Appeals that contain offensive material will be ignored. Added to that, anonymous letters will be ignored unless substantiated.
//         4.19. Outside Employment
// Employees will not take an outside job, either for pay or as a donation of their personal time, with a customer or competitor of LBAN; nor may employees work on their own if it competes or interferes in any way with the sales of products or services that LBAN provides to its clients.
//         4.20. Exit Interview
// In a voluntary separation situation, LBAN management would like to conduct an exit interview to discuss the employee’s reasons for leaving and any other impressions that the employee may have about the company which should be conducted by the Head, HR unit.

//         4.21. Return of Company Property
// Any LBAN property issued to employees, such as, computer equipment, Office keys, Identification card, HMO card, CUG line etc must be returned to the HR department at the time of termination. Employees will be responsible for any lost or damaged items.

//         5.2. Annual Performance Bonus

The performance appraisal process is an automated form that contains self-evaluation and managers input on target achievement and discussion between the employee and the manager, and the exercise will be completed upon acceptance of manager’s score by the employee.

            4.17.1. Warning for Misconduct
Where an offence is committed which is not sufficiently serious to warrant summary dismissal or termination with notice, an official warning will be issued.  For the first offence “FIRST WARNING” will be issued, and for the second offence the “SECOND WARNING” will also be issued and can be followed by a suspension. If a third offence is then committed, within one year, the staff’s services may be terminated.
The implication of a warning letter given is that the staff loses an opportunity (if due) for a promotion or salary increment within six (6) months of the receipt of the warning letter. Warnings for offences and for inefficiency are cumulative and will be viewed together when considering further disciplinary action to be taken against an erring staff. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a staff can be summarily dismissed for gross misconduct depending on the severity of the incident.
Human Resource Department monitors attendance and punctuality records of all members of staff. A non-adherence to this policy may lead to the termination of an employee. Further disciplinary actions that may be taken are as follows:
    i. 1st offence of lateness for minimum of 2 times in a month attracts a reprimand letter.
    ii. 2nd offence of lateness for a minimum of 2 times a month attracts 1st warning letter.
    iii. Where warning letter is issued and lateness persists 2 times in a month, this attracts 2nd and final warning letter.
    iv. If such poor punctuality records persist, this attracts 3 days suspension from work without pay, and failure to improve may lead the organization to review the continuous employment of the staff.
            4.17.2. Suspension
Where an employee commits any serious misconduct, he/she may be suspended from duty without pay pending an investigation of the situation. Depending on the outcome of the investigation, the employee may be recalled to duty or the employee’s appointment may be terminated without any previous disciplinary action having been taken.
The implication of Suspension is that apart from the time of seclusion without pay, the staff loses the opportunity (if due) for a promotion or salary increment within six (6) months from the effective date of the suspension.
        4.18. Grievance Procedure

A staff who feels that he/she has a grievance or feels that he/she has been subjected to unfair treatment may put such grievance or complaint in writing to management through the Human Resource Department.
As a first step, the staff who has a grievance shall make this known as soon as possible to his immediate supervisor.
If after 2 days the staff concerned has had no satisfactory answer or action taken on his/her grievance, he may then ask his/her manager to forward it to the Human Resource Department for disciplinary and further action.
If after further seven days the matter has still not been brought to satisfactory conclusion, it may then be referred to the Executive Director directly. If after a further two weeks the matter is still not resolved satisfactorily, it may then be referred to the Managing Director whose decision on the matter is final.
In order that appeals can be dealt with expeditiously without the need to refer for further information, supervisors transmitting appeals to higher authority must add their comments and suggestions when forwarding such appeals and indicate on the appeal that it has been submitted through them.
Allegations made in appeals should normally be supported by proofs. Appeals that contain offensive material will be ignored. Added to that, anonymous letters will be ignored unless substantiated.
